# Description: Implement a simple version of the "Black Box Game".
# It takes place on a 10x10 grid. Rows 0 and 9, and columns 0 and 9 (border squares), are used by the guessing
# player for shooting rays into the black box. The atoms are restricted to being within rows 1-8 and columns 1-8
# Each player starts with 25 points. Each entry and exit location counts as a point (but not more than once),
# each wrong guess of an atom's location costs 5 points (but not for duplicate guesses).
# This is all accomplished using a class named BlackBoxGame and methods to methods to set up the board, place atoms,
# display the board (for testing purposes),
# shoot rays, check the results of shooting rays and account for hits/reflects/deflects,
# and it will allow players to guess an atoms location and keep track of their score
